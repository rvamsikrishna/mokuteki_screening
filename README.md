# mokuteki_screening

A new Flutter project.

## Goal
> Create a Object of your choice in the center of the app. The object must be done either with flare (2dimensions.com) or with flutter painter. Implement 9 different way for a user to interact with that object.

## Result
Created a creature which comes to life when tapped on it. It can change its colors on tap or even continuosly change to different colors. It also shifts its color to the color of particle that it crosses over.

## Interactions
1. Click on the circle to start/pause
2. You can drag the creature horizontally
3. Double-tap on the creature to change color
4. Long press on creature to start/stop continuosly change colors
5. When overlapped on the different colored particles falling from above the creature changes color to that particular color of the particle

This can further be worked on to convert it into a game with points and levels.
